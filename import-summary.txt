ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* .project_plus
* Almalence Imaging SDK for Open Camera - LICENSE.pdf
* LICENSE
* README.md
* default.properties
* doc\
* doc\Almalence GUI.doc
* doc\Developer's guide - Plugins creation.doc
* doc\GUI customization.doc
* doc\OpenCam draft structure.doc
* doc\SharedMemory.txt
* doc\android-tree-build\
* doc\android-tree-build\Android.mk
* doc\android-tree-build\instructions.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* jni\ => app\src\main\jni\
* libs\android-support-v13.jar => app\libs\android-support-v13.jar
* libs\androidexiv2.jar => app\libs\androidexiv2.jar
* libs\openiab-0.9.8.6.jar => app\libs\openiab-0.9.8.6.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
